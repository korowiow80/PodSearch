                    <div class="clr16"></div>
                    <div class="postcontent"><p>During 2012 devout Muslims need to observe their religious obligations in order to maintain their position of submission to God. These five obligations are grouped together and described as The Five Pillars of Islam. The Quran sets out these as the basis under which a Muslim shows his true commitment. The first of these five is the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Makkah, which every able-bodied Muslim must complete at least once in their life. Hajj 2012 is estimated to take place from October 24th to 27th, and Hajj packages 2012 are still available. To guarantee a safe and devout Hajj, pilgrims should look for a reliable and long-standing Hajj and Umrah travel operator. Such an agent will provide Hajj Packages that guide pilgrims through their preparation for the journey to Makkah, as well as experienced guides to steer groups through the intricacies of the  <a href='http://www.webuyanyhouse.co.uk/we-buy-any-house-scotland' title='we buy any house Scotland'>we buy any house Scotland</a> Hajj and to arrange things like the Qurbani sacrifice. Without such service a Hajj Package is unsatisfactory. The shahada, or profession of faith constitutes another pillar. &#8220;There is no God but God, and Muhammad is the prophet of God&#8221; is the Muslim creed that is normally recited in Arabic. As well as being a constant profession of faith to God and the prophet, a dying Muslim should also recite the shahada. Every day in 2012 and for every day for the rest of their lives Muslims should pray five times, the salat. Each of these prayers is slightly different and corresponds to a different time of the day. But each one repeats the raka&#8217;at, or unit of prayer, at least twice. Before prayer, Wudu, cleansing of the body, should be performed, and the believer must face the Ka&#8217;bah in Makkah while praying. The giving of alms is an important part of being Muslim.</p>

Home Page &gt; Careers &gt; Career Management &gt; Best Catering Jobs to Land in 2012 Best Catering Jobs to Land in 2012 Posted: Jan 02, 2012 |Comments: 0 | People working in catering often say that their industry is both the best and the worst. I didn&#8217;t understand this contradictory statement the first time someone shared it with me, but after almost a decade of working in various catering positions it&#8217;s all very clear. The requirements of customer facing role combined with dynamism needed for smooth execution of daily routines have no equi <a href='http://arthritispainreliefpills.com' title='arthritis pain'>arthritis pain</a> valent and need to be experienced first-hand in order to be fully appreciated. The downside mentioned earlier is that it takes a large chunk of your life &#8211; and that means long hours; double shifts are not uncommon regardless of what health and safety regulations say. Christmas period, New Year&#8217;s Eve and so on are the best time for the business so you&#8217;re expected to work. For the right type of person it&#8217;s a heaven on earth but some roles are more enjoyable than others. For example, working in restaurant kitchen is better paid but more mundane than table service, on the other hand working behind the bar is more exciting and could be better paid than kitchen role. Let&#8217;s have a look at the best catering jobs in year 2012 so you can choose the right one. Waiter / waitress is the role most often associated with catering and it shouldn&#8217;t surprise anyone.</p>

                    <div class="clr16"></div>
                    <div class="postcontent"><p>Is seems that in this economy and market, many prospective home buyers have left the market and they along with others who have faced an unfortunate foreclosure may be looking for properties to rent until they can get back on their feet. Being a landlord can be profitable, especially if you are in a resort area or your properties are located near a college or a university. It can be a chancy proposition though if you are not educated in rental property ownership or if your personality does not fit with what a landlord has to face and do! Recently there was a survey and it found the 44% of RPO&#8217;s (rental property owners) lost money on their investments. Yet if done right the profits, tax advantages and building of equity can allay any pro <a href='http://appetitesuppressant.org.uk/fullfast' title='buy fullfast'>buy fullfast</a> blems you have being a RPO. What about NOW? It&#8217;s true that &#8220;if they can&#8217;t afford to buy, they may be able to afford to rent&#8221;. This means you need to know your market before you jump into the RPO business. Check out the local rental ads, how many are there? What sort of rents are they asking for, and in what areas? Gauge for yourself how competitive the market for Rental Properties is currently. Is there a Rental Property Owner&#8217;s association in your area? Might be a good idea to check it out, as they keep track of dead beat tenants who try to &#8220;play&#8221; the eviction game and they can also be a source of good information about the local market for rentals. Thus, if the market is inundated with Rentals, it may not be wise to enter the game yet.</p>

When you observe the actions they take, the places they spend their time, the books they read, the way they talk and how they conduct their lives. You have a set of guidelines that you can use to structure your life, a recipe for creating similar success in your own life. kredittkort The same is true for the people in your environment that constantly make the same errors in judgement and seem to be trapped on a treadmill of challenges. When you observe their behaviours, you become aware of all the places to avoid, things not to do, in fact you have a perfect blue print for helping you to eliminate all the things from your life that are holding you back an <a href='http://www.kredittkorttest.no/kredittkort-for-studenter' title='kredittkort student'>kredittkort student</a> d student keeping you trapped in the average. There is a school of thinking that promotes the idea that states, we must only focus on the positive going on around us and that we must avoid even seeing or allowing ourselves to be exposed to any negative in our lives. I think this is a very naive strategy and only gives you half of the picture. I most certainly do not want to kredittkort student go through my life only seeing half of the picture and living an unrealistic life, in which I believe that everything should just be positive and go smoothly. It is this very unrealistic set of expectations that actually sets people up for massive and unexpected falls. Just as there is no such thing as a one sided, positive magnet, there too is no such thing as a one sided positive life.</p>
